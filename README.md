# SignLearn

SignLearn is a deep learning project aimed at detecting and recognizing sign languages using computer vision techniques. This project focuses on improving sign language modeling through action detection. The goal is to create a system that can accurately interpret and translate sign language gestures into text or speech, aiding communication for the hearing impaired.

## Overview

Sign languages are an essential means of communication for individuals with hearing impairments. However, recognizing and understanding sign languages can be challenging for those unfamiliar with them. SignLearn aims to bridge this gap by providing a tool that can detect and recognize sign languages in real-time, making communication more accessible and inclusive.
## Features

- __Real-time sign language detection:__ SignLearn can detect and recognize sign languages in real-time, allowing for instant communication.

- __User-friendly interface:__ The project includes a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to interact with the application.

- __Multi-model comparison:__ SignLearn includes multiple deep learning models for sign language detection, allowing for the comparison of their performance.

- __Educational tool:__ SignLearn can also be used as an educational tool to learn and practice sign languages.

## Installation and Usage

To install SignLearn, follow these steps:


1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/avanishgarg/SignLearn.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the [Real-Time.ipynb](https://github.com/avanishgarg/SignLearn/blob/main/Real-Time.ipynb) file

4. Choose one of the many weights provided in the [weights](https://github.com/avanishgarg/SignLearn/tree/main/weights) folder

5. You can train a new LSTM or CNN Model and tune its hyperparameters and create new weights by executing the [SignLearn.ipynb](https://github.com/avanishgarg/SignLearn/blob/main/SignLearn.ipynb) or [SignLearn-CNN.ipynb](https://github.com/avanishgarg/SignLearn/blob/main/SignLearn-CNN.ipynb) files
